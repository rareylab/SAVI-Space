# SAVI-Space

![Title Image](images/SAVISpace.png)

Welcome to the **SAVI-Space** repository, which contains the Python-based code and tools for the preparation of building blocks used in the SAVI-Space project. This repository focuses on preprocessing, validation, and preparation of molecular fragment space generation.

## CHMTRN/PATRAN parser

The CHMTRN/PATRAN parser is a tool that reads the CHMTRN/PATRAN freaction pattern and converts them into reaction SMARTS. The tool is written in Python.

The tool is able to parse the CHMTRN/PATRAN string and convert it into a reaction SMARTS string:
```bash
python src/transpiler/transpiler.py <PARTAN/CHMTRN string>
```
or alternatively a json file containing the CHMTRN/PATRAN string:
```bash
python src/transpiler/transpiler.py -f <json file> -o <output file>
```

## Space creation


The code is organized into three main components:

---

### 1. **Building Block Molecule Standardization and Filtering Tool**

This module handles the preprocessing of molecular building blocks, ensuring consistency and quality. The key functionalities include:

#### **Standardization**
- Automatically cleans and standardizes molecular structures.
- Normalizes charges, removes invalid atoms, and ensures uniformity by removing stereochemistry and atom mappings.

#### **File Format Conversion**
- Converts `.sdf` files to `.smi` format for enhanced compatibility with downstream tools.

#### **Validation**
- Filters valid molecules using the RDKit library.
- Offers optional validation using an external `naomi_check` binary.

#### **Disconnected SMILES Fragmentation**
- Decomposes disconnected SMILES strings into individual fragments for independent analysis.

#### **Filtering Options**
- Filters molecules based on:
  - **Heavy Atom Count:** `min_heavy_atoms`, `max_heavy_atoms`.
  - **Molecular Weight:** `min_molecular_weight`, `max_molecular_weight`.
  - **Bertz Complexity Index:** `max_bertz_ct`.

#### **Parallel Processing**
- Leverages multi-core processing for faster execution.

#### **Duplicate Removal**
- Groups and deduplicates SMILES entries, combining associated names.

#### **Logging**
- Provides detailed logs for every processing step, ensuring transparency and traceability.

---

### 2. **Reactant (Building Block) Validation Tool**

This component validates building blocks against specified criteria to ensure their suitability for reaction-based applications. Its main features include:

#### **SMARTS Matching**
- Matches reactants to predefined SMARTS patterns to identify valid reaction sites.
- Includes advanced options to:
  - Exclude exocyclic double bonds.
  - Ensure unique matches across reactants.

#### **Kill Logic**
- Implements customizable "kill logic" to filter out unwanted reactants using SMARTS-based rules.

#### **Extensible Input/Output**
- Accepts SMILES strings as input.
- Outputs detailed CSV files with:
  - Match statistics.
  - Filtered results based on "kill" criteria.

### 3. **Space Generation Preparation**

This module prepares preprocessed building blocks for space generation, catering to two distinct toolkits:

**Colibri Toolkit and Naomi Toolkit**

---

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - RDKit
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Additional dependencies detailed in `requirements.txt`.

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rareylab/SAVI-Space.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Usage**
#### **Building Block Molecule Standardization and Filtering Tool**

This tool standardizes and filters building blocks in `.sdf` or `.smi` format. To use the tool:

Run the standardization script:
   ```bash
   python src/standardize_bbs.py --input building_blocks.sdf
   ```

The standardized output will be saved as `building_blocks_standardized.smi`.

The filtering options can be customized using command-line arguments:
e.g., filtering by heavy atom count of minimum 10 and a maximum molecular weight of 500:
   ```bash
   python src/standardize_bbs.py --input building_blocks.sdf --min_heavy_atoms 10 --max_molecular_weight 500
   ```
A coma-separated list of filtering values is stored as `building_blocks.csv`.

Moreover, the tool can split disconnected SMILES strings into fragments:
   ```bash
   python src/standardize_bbs.py --input building_blocks.sdf --divide_disconnected_smiles
   ```
   The output will be saved as `building_blocks_fragments.smi` and `building_blocks_fragments_standardized.smi`.


#### **Reactant (Building Block) Validation Tool**

This tool validates building blocks against predefined SMARTS patterns and kill logic. To use the tool:

Run the validation script:
   ```bash
   python src/space_builder/reactants_validation.py -n SAVI-Space-2024 -r building_blocks.smi --apply_kill
   ```
The output will be saved at `SAVI-Space-2024/`. You can specify a path using the `-o` argument.
   ```bash
   python src/space_builder/reactants_validation.py -n SAVI-Space-2024 -r building_blocks.smi --apply_kill -o path/to/output
   ```
   Will be saved at `path/to/output/SAVI-Space-2024/`.

Additionaly the match logics can be customized using the `--unify_matches`:
- Unify matches on the same atoms.

or the `--unique_matches` flag:
- Unify matches based on the given indices.

#### **Space Generation Preparation**

This module prepares building blocks and reactions for space generation using the Colibri or Naomi toolkit. To use the tool:

- For Colibri:
   ```bash
   python src/space_builder/Colibri_space_creation.py -n SAVI-Space-2024
   ```

- For Naomi:
   ```bash
   python src/space_builder/Naomi_space_creation.py -n SAVI-Space-2024
   ```
A bash script will be generated to run the toolkit.
In the script, the paths to the executables should be specified.
